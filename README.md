# Digital-Signal-Processing-Project-
**Implementation and Optimisation of Discrete Fourier Tranform (DCT) Algorithm**
This is a course project for Digital Signal Processing by **Abubakar Ndagi and Nesrine Merabti**
Please find attached to this repository a pdf document which contains detailed explanations on how the Discrete Fourier Transform algorithm was implemented and how it was optimized.
